#Coding Frameworks

####Notes
- Used to be that we made decisions based on what we thought the client wanted and what we thought looked good, there was no data backing up the decisons
- Now we are moving more into user-centered design
- Although many people think usability and UX are the same, they aren't
    + UX addresses how a user feels when using a system, while usability is about the user-friendliness and efficiency of the interface.
- The user experience is made up of all the interactions a person has with your brand, company, or organization

- What does a UX Designer Do?
    + Research
        * Subjective Research
            - “What is your favorite color?”
            - “Do you trust this company?”
            - “Does my ass look fat in these pants?”
        * Objective Research
            - “How long did you spend using our app?”
            - “Where did you find the link to our site?”
            - “How many people visited our website today?”
        * Sample Size: the more people the better
    + Testing
        * User Interviews
            - 3 Basic Types of questions:
                + Open - “How would you describe me?” 
                + Leading - "What are my nerdiest features"?
                + Closed/Direct - "What is prettier my hair or my eyes"?
        * User Tests
        * A/B and Multivariate Testing
    + Wireframes
        * Wireframes are developed to prototype distribution of existing site content for testing and iteration before the graphic interface and code are developed.
    + Personas
        * ARE NOT:
            - Personality types
            - Demographics
            - Characters in your “brand story”
            - Stereotypes based on your experience
            - Shallow or 1-dimensional
            - Concepts
            - Predictions
        * They describe the goals, expectations, motivations, and behaviour of real people. Why do they come to your site? What are they looking for? What makes them nervous?

    + User Stories
        * A User Story describes one possible path a user can take on your site or app. It should be short, but complete. You will need many user stories to describe your whole design.
