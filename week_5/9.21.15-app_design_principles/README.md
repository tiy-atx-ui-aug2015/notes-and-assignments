# Principles of App Design

####Notes
Clarity:
- Immediate ability to recognize what the application does and why they should care about it (http://authenticweather.com/)

Conservation:
- Human working memory has low capacity
- Progressive Disclosure (
lingo)
- Visual noise = percieved complexity

Hierarchy:
- An effective hierarchy employs just enough meaningful differentiation to walk users through the unique content and actions on a page in a purposeful order.
- Youâ€™ll see a lot less visual hierarchy there because the predominate user action is continuous exploration. (Craigslist, Spotify)
- Look for anything in your design that requires users to read text, remember information, or make a decision. Then look for alternatives: can you show a picture, re-display previously entered information, or set a smart default? 
- Focal points for main actions (godaddy vs name.com)
- Visual flow (fb vs italki vs google vs wikipedia)

Consistency:
(Dropbox vs. Basecamp)
- Need to user test ahead of time to prevent bias in design
- External (from other sites) vs Internal (within your own site)
- Satisfy expectations (don't reinvent the wheel) - a person should be able to predict how an interaction will work -- BE CAREFUL WHEN USING ICONS (Hootsuite vs any.do vs. evernote)
- Take the path of least resistance
- A clean, visually consistent site gives users feelings of comfort, control,
and familiarity, whether consciously or not.
- Areas of Visual Consistency
    - Typography
    - Spacial Relationships
    - Size
    - Images
    - Colors
- UI Patterns

    - Affordances (what it can do) vs Signifiers (what it suggests)
        - Perceived affordance
        - When signifiers are used properly, the product feels intuitive and
        familiar, as if the user already knows what the feature is for. A
        signifier can be anything that suggests meaning, whether a word,
        a shape, a color, or a movement.
    - Navigation
    - Content (hierarchy)
    - Reducing Friction
    - Incentivizing 
        - progress bars
        - gamification
    - Social Sharing
    - Tactical (color of links, logo in top left) vs Strategic (which is better, sticky nav or regular)
    - First visual design is usually a design dump - Refine first design to make related items visually consistent
