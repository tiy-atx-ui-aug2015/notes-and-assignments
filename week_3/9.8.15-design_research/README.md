# Design Research and Discovery

####Notes
- What is design research?
    + plan
    + observe
    + design
    + prototype
    + test
- Why design research?
    + seeking out data and information to inform design decisions
    + Erika Hall's Just Enough Research reasons for design research
        * solves a design problem (that the client may or may not be aware of )
        * Discover cultural, social, or economical factors that may not have been previously obvious
            - http://alistapart.com/article/culturalprobe
        * competitive edge
        * setting valid goals for the forseeable future
    + Why else?
        * figure out the company and the user's core purposes (may be different)
        * use research to narrow down options
        * add value to the design

- Benefits of Design Research 
    + defend decisions
    + get designers, developers, and clients on the same page (kickoff meeting)
    + design based on fact rather than assumption 
    + design based on the needs of the user (no more I likes!)
    + sets us up with a strategy rather than a blank page
- What happens without research?
    + risk factors go up
        * going off brand
        * possibility of insulting the audience
            - #whyIstayed by Dijorno
        * harming user experience
        * mismatched trends applied to product design
    + heavy reliance on design trends that aren't necessarily the best option for the company/user
        * hamburger menu
            - test
        * flat design: resurgence of modernism
        * parallax scrolling:
            - bloated, not cross-browser friendly
            - more effort to scroll
            - studies show it can cause vestibular side effects or vertigo in 30% of people
    + decisions become subjective
    + don't solve the right problem
- How do we Research?
    + plan
        * what is the core purpose of this project?
            - goals of company and goals of users lead to:
                + What is the core purpose of this design change?
                    * solve a problem
                    * Sell something
                    * build guidlines or structure
                    * compete

        * who are your target users?
            - user stories
        * what research methods will you use?
            - Qualitative
                + background checks/history of company
                + interviews
                    * Client - What is the core purpose of the company?
                        - who are you?
                        - who needs to know?
                        - how will they find out?
                        - why should they care?
                    * User - What is the core purpose of the user?
            - Quantitative
                + competitive market study
                    * what are we doing right
                    * what are we doing wrong
                    * what are thye doing right
                    * what are they doing wrong
                    * what can we do differently
                    * will it alienate our users
                + SWOT analysis
                    * strengths 
                    * weaknesses
                    * opportunities
                    * threats
                + User Interviews
                    * you are interviewing for the user, not for the client
                    * remove the inclination to assume what the user needs or what they will say
                    * ask general questions to guage experience and needs
                    * analzye what you learned
                    * http://codepen.seesparkbox.com/
            - Internal or external competitive audits    
        * what questions will you ask?
    + observe
        * conduct research
    + design
        * use research to come up with design concepts
        * observe again to determin best direction(s)
    + prototype
        * create a prototype of your design solution
    + test
        * test the prototype on users to make sure your hypotheses are founded
    + User Research - Before
        * who will use this design?
        * how does this concept work in the context of our usersâ€™ workflow
    + User Testing - After
        * how effective is this design?
- What do wo do with the data?
    + Wordlists
    + Merge the unexpected
    + Find patterns and similarities
    + Iterate and prototype
