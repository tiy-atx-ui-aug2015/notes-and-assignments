# Portfolio Research

#### Description
See how people perceive you by creating a survey and sending to friends, family, and aquaintances.  The survey should includ 3-5 questionst that you think will be beneficial in deciding your direction for your portfolio site.  An example would be:

-  3 to 5 adjectives you would use to describe me (the good and the bad!)
-  A color that you think represents me well (feel free to send a picture with the color if you have an exact shade in mind -- or just be descriptive!)
-  A city (anywhere in the world) that you think would be the ideal place for me to live and why

Make sure you aren't only asking people that know you really well (diversify your audience).  Also make sure your questions encourage people to comment on all sides of you (not just the good ones).
