# Branding Intro

#### Notes
- History of Branding
    + Started with cattle ranchers in 19th century
    + People started branding all types of products in late 1800's
    + In late 20th century, marketers began to realize there was more to a brand than it's name (that set it apart from others in the same industry)
    + started to see the brand as "the intangible sum of a product’s attributes" and realized they could change a consumers perspective of the qualities and attributes of a product
- What is a brand?
    + everythign the public knows about your product, both factual and emotional
    + people with a connection to the brand may associate it/call it different things (Tar-je = chic Target, Whole Foods = Whole Paycheck)
    + Branding is not a logo
    + Branding is not marketing
        * Marketing is pushing a product or service on consumers
        * Branding is how a product or service makes a person feel
        * Branding is strategic, marketing is tactical
            - branding sticks in your mind whether you bought the product/service or not
            - Marketing unearths and activates buyers. Branding makes loyal customers, advocates, even evangelists, out of those who buy.
    + Parts of a Brand
        * Brand Promise: a brand is a promise to consumers. What will consumers get when they purchase a product or service under your brand umbrella? 
            - includes the feelings that consumers get when they use your products and services.

        * Brand Perception
            - Ultimately, it’s the way consumers perceive a brand that defines it. It doesn’t matter what you think your brand promises. The only thing that matters is how consumers perceive your brand.
            - You need to work to develop consumer perceptions that accurately reflect your brand
            - Exercise: What brands do you love? Why? What brands do you hate? Why?
        * Brand Expectations
            - If your brand doesn’t meet consumer expectations in every interaction, consumers will become confused by your brand and turn away from it in search of another brand that does meet their expectations in every interaction.
        * Brand Persona
            - “Who is a brand?” Every brand has a persona. Think of your brand as a person. What is that person like? What can you expect when you interact with that person? From appearance to personality and everything in between, your brand persona is one that consumers will evaluate and judge before they do business with you.
            - Example: Apple vs. Microsoft

            - What is the difference between the two personas? Why would you rather be friends with one than the other?
        * Brand Elements
            - Logo
            - Typography
            - Colors
            - Messaging 
            - Packaging
            - Make sure brand elements meet expectation of the brand mission/vision, and also the expectations of the customers
    + Branding is about building a tribe
        * SWOT Analysis can be very helpful to differentiate
        * Customers want to be a part of something
        * Harley Davidson
