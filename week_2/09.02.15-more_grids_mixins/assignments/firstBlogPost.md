#### Description
Write your first blog post in Markdown about your experience in week 1 and week 2 of the Iron Yard UI Design class. Itâ€™s totally okay to totally be yourself and write in first person and be honest about your experience. What have you liked? What have you not liked? Feel free to include links to any of your projects, any articles you loved/hated reading, or even links to your github profile. Remember to use Markdown syntax on this. Soon, we will add them to an actual blog.
