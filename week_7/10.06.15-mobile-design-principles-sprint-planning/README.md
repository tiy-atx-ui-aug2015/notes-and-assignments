# Mobile App Principles

#### Notes
- Advantages of Responsive Sites:
    + Build Once, run everywhere
    + requires a mobile browser
    + works across all/most platforms
- Advantages of Mobile Apps
    - High Def. Graphics
    - Cool effects
    - Leverage device's internal features (camera, accelerometer, etc.)
    - Immediate response (push notifications)
    - Apps are more "sticky"
        + push notifications work even when app isn't on
        + leads to repeat interations, multiple engagement opportunities
        + in-app purchases
            * quick one click purchases encourage spending
        + geolocation
        + crossing over api's (fb or twitter signin)
- Mobile Experience is Unique:
    - Limited Real Estate
    - Pure Opt-In (User gets to choose apps)
    + Design For Distraction
        * People use mobile devices while doing other activities so you have to make actions clear and concise
        * Avoid landing pages
        * Remove sign up forms (use fb, twitter, etc.)

    + Accessiblity
        + Mobile Touch Hot Spots
        + Landscape and portrait mode
        + Different size devices
        + What happens if service goes out?
        + Feedback is SUPER important
        + Multiple ways to touch on a device
        + Thumb Flow

- Adopt, Use, Transact, Return
    + Adopt: Remove all possible road blocks for usage
        + If the user needs to learn something about how to use the app, use contextual hints
        + Use onboarding only if necessary, otherwise it increases ability to adopt (allow users to skip onboarding if they want)
    + Use
        * Make conversion decisions simple
        * Search is displayed prominently, uses auto complete, easy to filter
        * Information is easily scannable
    
- Designing for iOS
    + Tappable Targets
        * 44 x 44 points
    + iOS Anatomy
    + - Navigation
        * Users must always know where they are and where they can go
        * Navigation Bar: Use a navigation bar to give users an easy way to traverse a hierarchy of data. The navigation barâ€™s title can show users their current position in the hierarchy; the back button makes it easy to return to the previous level.
        * Tab Bar: Use a tab bar to display several peer categories of content or functionality. A tab bar is a good way to support a flat information architecture and its persistence lets people switch between categories regardless of their current location.
        * Page Control: Use a page control when each app screen represents an individual instance of the same type of item or page. A page control is good for showing users how many items or pages are available and which one is currently displayed. For example, Weather uses a page control to show how many location-specific weather pages the user has opened.
        * In general it's good to give users one path to each screen
