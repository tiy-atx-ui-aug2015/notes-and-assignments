# Creative Brief
Client: Austin City Shelter
Project: Pet Transport
Designers: Ryan, Liz, Daniel

## Assignment: What's our deliverable?
Designers will develop an invision prototype of an app that allows people to get approved as foster pet parents and matches foster pet parents with shelter volunteers to transport pets to and from adoption events and the shelter clinic for check ups.

## Program Background: What is the history of this client/site/business and the objective supporting this assignment?
A majority of Austin's adoptable animals are in foster homes, and more fosters are needed every day to keep Austin "no kill". The city shelter needs a way to better handle the foster process including ways to ensure that fosters pets can make it to the shelter clinic for medical needs and to adoption events around the city.

## Objective(s): What is our purpose? What are we trying to accomplish with this assignment?
The main purpose of the app is to connect foster pet parents with city shelter volunteer transport to transport foster pets to and from adoption events, to the city shelter clinic, etc. The secondary purpose is to allow foster pet parents to get approved by the shelter and find the right foster pet for their family.

## Target Audience, Demographics/Psychographics: Who are we communicating to? What do we know about the target?
The target audience is city shelter voluneers and foster pet parents. We know that they are dedicated and busy people who do what they do for their love of the animals.

## Opportunity: Based on the competitive marketplace, what presents itself as an opportunity?
How will this app add value to the brand?
The app will add value to the city shelter by making it easier to be a foster parent by having volunteers take care of transport needs. 

## Tone and Manner: What adjectives would you use to describe the product/service? What are
its attributes?
