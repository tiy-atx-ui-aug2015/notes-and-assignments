# Cool Design Agency Mobile Project

## Overview
For the next week, you'll be working in groups of 2 or 3 to complete a mobile app design for a client of the "Cool Design Agency". Your client will present you with a project brief during your kick off meeting and help you figure out user stories for this project.  Once you have your user stories, you will estimate them using points.  Each point is worth 30 minutes of work and each student should take 8 points of work per night. You must efficiently plan you week using 24 hour sprints.
