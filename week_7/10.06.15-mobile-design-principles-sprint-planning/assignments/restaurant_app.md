# Mobile App Brief
### Client: Feeding Austin
### Project: Extra's - Extra Food, Extra Hands, Extra Nourishment
### Designers: Jay, Alex

## Assignment: What's our deliverable?
[Designers] will develop an Invision prototype of an app to allow local restaurants to connect with volunteer food delivery drivers that will drive left over or donated food to the homeless throughout Austin.

## Program Background: What is the history of this client/site/business and the objective supporting this assignment?
The client's projects always focus on finding new, creative and effective ways to provide good food to those in need around the Austin community. They are always looking for efficient ways to help out those less fortunate and bring together the great citizens of Austin wanting to lend a hand. 

## Objective(s): What is our purpose? What are we trying to accomplish with this assignment?
The application should provide a clean, easy and intuitive application that is both quick and efficient for the busy restaurants and volunteers. Restaurants should have the ability to post when they have food, how much food is available (i.e. approximate amount of meals), and when they need the food to be picked up. Volunteers should be able to see this type of feed, or message of somesort, be able to connect with the restaurant and communicate that they are on their way to pick up the food. There should also be suggestions to volunteers of good locations around Austin that they can drop off the food to the homeless. 

## Target Audience, Demographics/Psychographics: Who are we communicating to? What do we know about the target?
The client is targeting any Austin restaurant willing to participate and donate food, and any Austin locals who drive a car that want to help out.

## Opportunity: Based on the competitive marketplace, what presents itself as an opportunity?
How will this app add value to the brand?
This application with allow Feeding Austin an additional, free avenue to connect more individuals in Austin with all the leftover food usually thrown to waste each day. The opportunity takes advantage of all the "Extra's" out there, minimizing organizational costs, a huge advantage for any non-profit organization.

iPhones

## Creative Considerations/ Mandatory Requirements: What should be considered when developing and creating this piece?
