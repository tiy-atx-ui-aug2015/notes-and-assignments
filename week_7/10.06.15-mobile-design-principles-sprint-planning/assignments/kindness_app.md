Project: Kindness Challenge App
Designers: Corey, Emily


## Assignment: What's our deliverable?
Designers will develop an invision prototype of an app to promote random acts of kindness.


## Program Background: What is the history of this client/site/business and the objective supporting this assignment?
The Altruism Alliance is an internationally recognized non-profit organization founded upon the powerful belief in kindness and dedicated to providing resources and tools that encourage acts of kindness.


## Objective(s): What is our purpose? What are we trying to accomplish with this assignment? 
Create a platform where people can share their stories and encourage/challenge others to do random acts of kindness in their communities.


## Target Audience, Demographics/Psychographics: Who are we communicating to? What do we know about the target? 
Anyone who is an example of generosity, compassion, gratitude, caring and is committed to leading their lives with kindness. Educators, students, communities.


## Opportunity: Based on the competitive marketplace, what presents itself as an opportunity?
How will this app add value to the brand?
The Altruism Alliance encourages people to use their tags on social media to share their acts of kindness during Random Acts of Kindness week.

It's an opportunity to create a community that practices, encourages and teaches kindness.
