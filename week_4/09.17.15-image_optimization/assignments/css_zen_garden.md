# CSS Zen Garden

#### Description
CSS Zen garden is a right of passage in the web design world.  All designers use the same HTML file, while manipulating the CSS to adjust the design of the site.  Using the research and style tiles you created yesterday, move straight into coding your CSS Zen Garden site (no mockups necessary).  **The only change you can make in the HTML is to change the .css extension to .scss**.  You can style existing tags and selectors in the HTML, use your knowledge of CSS selectors to target other elements on the page, and use pseudo classes to add elements with :before and :after.  

Be creative! **This should not be easy.** You should be researching new possibilities with CSS and pushing the boundaries of what you know.  You must use at least:

- 1 :before element
- 1 :after element
- 1 CSS Animation
- 2 breakpoints

#### Objectives
- Be able to use CSS to style a website without changing any HTML
- Be able to emulate a style tile without creating a mockup

#### Performance Objectives
After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively
- Rapidly prototype a website (go straight from style tile to code)
- Use different CSS properties and values to push the boundaries of web design
- Use CSS pseudo classes to add elements to or modify elements on a page
