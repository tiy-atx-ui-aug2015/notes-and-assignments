1. Create a GitHub repo for your final project.  Make sure the name of your project is specific to what you will be doing (not just "final project").
2. Add links to your LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. at the bottom of the repo README so interested people can contact you about your project.
3. Create a schedule (hour for hour) for the next 3 weeks (when will you be working and when will you be breaking). 
4. Come up with 2-3 personal goals for this project.  They can be either specific (ie. "I want to use the grid mixin effectively") or broad (ie. "I want to make sure I maintain consistency across my site").
